Based on Ã†ndrew Rininsland's [tutorial](https://medium.com/journocoders/create-a-news-game-with-ink-react-and-redux-part-ii-playing-your-game-on-the-web-5216e33043df), a simple news game example. Added a "undo last step" feature which was created with [Redux Undo](https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo) & Ink's own state.toJson & state.LoadJson methods. 

Everything should work with ```npm install; npm start```. The "Rewind" button should appear after the first choice is made. 
 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
